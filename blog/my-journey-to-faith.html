            It was a quiet midnight, the world around me was still, but my heart was restless. I found myself drawn to prayer, not out of routine, but by a gentle nudge I could not ignore. As I knelt beside my bed, the presence of God filled the room in a way I had never experienced before.

        </blockquote>
        <p>
            In that sacred hour, the Lord spoke to my heart about surrender, trust, and the power of seeking Him in the secret place. Tears flowed as I realized how much He longed for my attention—not just my service, but my heart. That night, I made a fresh commitment to pursue Him above all else.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since that midnight encounter, my walk with Christ has deepened. I have learned that God often meets us in the stillness, when we are most open to His voice. If you are longing for more, I encourage you: set aside time, even in the quiet of night, to seek Him. He is waiting to meet you there.
        </p>
