        <h2>The Spiritual Significance of Waking Between 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.</h2>
        <p>
            Waking up during these early hours is often seen as a divine invitation from God for deeper communion and revelation. Many believe that God calls His people during this time to draw closer, listen, and receive guidance.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Points on the Significance of These Hours:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Divine Opportunity:</strong> This period is described as a "window of divine opportunity" where the spiritual atmosphere is still and distractions are minimal.</li>
            <li><strong>Biblical Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exodus 14:24:</strong> The Lord worked miracles during the watch of the night.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mark 1:35:</strong> Jesus sought solitude for prayer in the early morning.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Spiritual Receptivity:</strong> Spirits are most receptive to the supernatural during these hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Thin Veil:</strong> The veil between the physical and spiritual worlds is believed to be thin, and human defenses are at their lowest.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pray Intentionally:</strong> Engage in deep prayer, thank God, and ask for guidance (Philippians 4:6). Practice stillness before God (Psalm 46:10).</li>
